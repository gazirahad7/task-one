### Task 1: Design & create a database based on data and show a report.

We have an API, which returns a set of data of the user, product, and purchase history of a store. When the
admin clicks on a button called “Generate Report” then data will fetch from API and save it in the database
and generate a report from it.

## Todo:

#### 1. Create/design database schema with proper table, entities, and attributes based on API data, (Separate into multiple tables if needed)

#### 2. When the admin clicks on the button, Fetch data from API and save it in the database and generate the report using SQL query or Query Builder or Eloquent.

#### 3. In the report, the admin can see the top purchaser of the store with proper information and the total(s). (Demo table shown below)
